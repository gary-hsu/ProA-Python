# This exercise will be very basic. Bear with me; it's good to have these fundamentals nailed in before we start hitting more complex material.
# We are given these three variables: a, b and c.

a = 5
b = 7
c = 32

# 1. Using the variables above, calculate and print (2a - 3b)/c


# 2. Calculate and print b^a


# 3. Calculate and print c mod b


# 4. Calculate and print (c mod b) * (c mod a).


# After you complete all the steps, input your answer for section 4 into the quiz.
