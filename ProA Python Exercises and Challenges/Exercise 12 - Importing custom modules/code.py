# 1. In this exercise, you will practice importing modules. Start out by importing module1 and running the SuccessFunction(). No arguments are needed.


# 2. In this next exercise, try and import only the FinishFunction() function. This function will need a True boolean passed to it. If correctly called with the True boolean, it will give you a value to paste into your quiz.
