# In this final challenge, you will be recreating the FOMI status sheet code. Given are the FOMI csv and a single status sheet. Open these in your favorite program to familiarize yourself with them.

#Some constraints: 
# You do not want to overwrite any signitures within the status sheet, even if they appear in the FOMI sheet.
# Try to get your final status sheet in the xlsx format.
# You will need to add some code to check how many items were signed off in the status sheet.

# After you successfully run the code, count the number of items signed off and submit that into the quiz.
