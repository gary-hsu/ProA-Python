# 1. You are going to write code that continually reduces the number of items in the list above until there are only 20 items left. Write a while loop function, in conjunction with the .pop() method, to remove items in the list until len(test_list) == 20.



# After the looping is complete, call the last item in the list. Copy and paste that item number into the quiz.
