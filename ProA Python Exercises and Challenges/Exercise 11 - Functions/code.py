# You are given the following function:

def test_function(a, b):
    return a

# 1. The function above simply takes two variables, and returns the first one. Your task is to change the function in a way that makes it so it compares the two values given, and only returns the greater value. If the values are equal, then just return that value. Below are print statements that can be used to test your function.

print(test_function(10, 20))

print(test_function(15, 9))

print(test_function(25, 25))

print(test_function(-16, 0))

# 2. Next, your goal is to create a brand new function from scratch. This function should take two variables, c and d. If and only if the values are equal, the function should return a boolean True. Otherwise, it should return False.



# 3. Lastly, you are given these two lists:

list_1 = [7,6,3,2,2,6,7,8,7,5,5,4,4,5,2,5,6,1,5,6,6]
list_2 = [9,9,9,8,3,3,4,5,7,3,3,1,1,2,4,6,7,3,3,2,6]

# Using a loop within a loop and your function, count the number of times there is a match between the lists. Consider using the += operator. Input this number into the quiz.
