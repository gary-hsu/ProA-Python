# We are given the following variables a, b, c, d, and e

a = 3
b = 4
c = 7
d = 8
e = 8.5

# Write out the following conditionals. Print out the results. An example has been given.

# 1. a is greater than or equal to b

print(a >= b)

# 2. b is less than d


# 3. (d - b) is greater than or equal to b


# 4. d is equal to e


# 5. ((a + b) / d) + c is equal to e


# Afterwards, count the number of conditionals that came back as True and input the number into the quiz.
