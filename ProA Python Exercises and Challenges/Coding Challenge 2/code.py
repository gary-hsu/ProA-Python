# You have a large stack of microchips on your desk. These microchips come in various sizes. One day, an incompetant coworker accidently
# mixes a box of his microchips with yours, also of various sizes. You scramble and grab every uniquely size chips you can find. The
# following lengths were recorded in micrometers:

chip_1_length = 112
chip_2_length = 125
chip_3_length = 139
chip_4_length = 149
chip_5_length = 154
chip_6_length = 182

# You know that, based on the way that your chips were manufactured, their lengths only come in lengths divisible by 7 micrometers.
# 1. Using your new found knowledge of coding, print out a conditional that can check if a chip is one of yours. Then run this code on
# all of the chips.


# 2. Afterwards, take all the chips that you deemed as yours and add the lengths together. Record this value into the quiz.
