# These last two challenges will be tougher and very open-ended. Utalize any tools to your benefit, including documentation, stack exchange, etc. These will effectively be reverse engineering the code that I had written. Good luck!

# In this challenge, you are given a partially filled FOMI sheet. Your goal is to separate this single csv into multiple csvs. There should be a todo csv, which will be all of the items that have yet to be filled. Next, there should be a problem csv, which should contain all the items that were deemed as a problem. Lastly, there should be a finished csv, with all of the items deemed OK.

# If you aren't familiar with the FOMI csv, you can double click it within VScode, or open it with Excel/Google Sheets/Libre Sheets. The final csv should be able to be opened by the FOMI tool.

#After the separation is complete, count the number of items listed as problematic and input this value into the quiz.
