### We are given two separate lists:

list_1 = ["EE53302-1","EE53302-2","EE53352-1","EE53352-2","EE53708-1","EE53708-2","EE53714","EE53728-1","EE53728-2","EE53734","EE53820","EE53825","EE53925"]

list_2 = ["EE53110-1","EE53110-2","EE53130-1","EE53130-2","EE53202-1","EE53202-2","EE53252-1","EE53252-2","EE53302-1","EE53302-2","EE53352-1","EE53352-2","EE53708-1"]


# 1. Using two for loops, check for any repeated item numbers and append them into the repeats_list list below. This time, you will be writing the loops from scratch.

repeats_list = []


# 2. Get the length of the repeats_list list and input this value into the quiz.
